// IS THE GATE VACUOUS?
//
// A gate can pass for two very different reasons:
//
//   (a) the system cannot do the bad thing;
//   (b) somebody wrote a function that would prevent the bad thing, and the gate
//       calls that function.
//
// (b) is not safety. It is a library. The CTO named this exact failure when rejecting
// the expression evaluator from the 0.8.0 release: "Bar 4 is satisfied only vacuously
// — the evaluator has zero call sites."
//
// `governance-gate.mjs` now tests `buildScope()` and `safeNavigate()`. Both work. But
// nothing in the renderer, the atoms, or the data layer calls either one. So:
//
//   "an expression cannot read PII held in state"  is really
//   "an expression cannot read PII held in state, PROVIDED the caller opts in"
//
// A caller who forgets is not prevented from anything. This file makes that gap
// visible, and it is the second half of every G-gate: the primitive must exist AND
// the system must be unable to bypass it.
//
//   node spike/gate-wiring.mjs
